1. There are total of 1260 possible states when 5 pieces have been placed. 
   I came up with this answer because there are 9 places where X can place its 3 pieces.
   O has 6 leftover places where it can place its 2 pieces. 
   The combinations comes out to be 84 for X's and 15 for O's.
   So, if we multiply these numbers to find all the possibilty, we can find 1260.

2. There are total of 26640900 possible states after the six moves.
   I used the exact same method as the first one.
   There were 27 places for X to place its 2 pieces.
   25 places for Y to place its 2 pieces, and 23 places for Z to place its 2 pieces.
   The combinations come out to be 351, 300, 253 for X, Y, and Z, respectively.
   Multiplying these numbers, we get 26640900.
